# Assembly
A series of programs written in Assembly Language (MASM)

> # Program 1 - Integer Arithmetic
> Asks user to enter 2 integers. Calculates and diplays the sum, difference, product, and quotient/remainder of those numbers.
> ## What I learned:
> 1. MASM language  
> 2. Defining/Initializing variables  
> 3. I/O libraries  
> 4. Integer arithmetic  
> 5. Virtual machines  
> 6. Computer architecture  
> 7. Machine language/instructions

> # Program 2 - Fibonacci Numbers
> Asks user to enter how many Fib #'s, then displays that many Fib #'s to the screen.
> ## What I learned:
> 1. String input  
> 2. Counted loops  
> 3. Post-test loops  
> 4. Input validation  
> 5. Addressing modes

> # Program 3 - Accumulator
> Asks user to continually enter integers. As soon as a negative integer is entered, the previous integers are averaged. The quantity, the sum, and the average of the integers is displayed to the user.
> ## What I learned:
> 1. Data validation  
> 2. Accumulators  
> 3. Control structures  
> 4. Modular development  
> 5. Debugging  
> 6. Internal/External data representation

> # Program 4 - Composite Numbers
> Asks user how many composites to calculate, then for an integer. Calculates that given number of composites, up to the integer given.
> ## What I learned:
> 1. Nested loops  
> 2. Procedures  
> 3. Binary arithmetic  
> 4. Floating point notation  
> 5. Parity, error detection/correction  
> 6. Hamming codes  
> 7. Byte ordering

> # Program 5 - Sorted Array
> Asks user how large to make an array, then for that number of integers. Displays the numbers in given order, then sorts the numbers and displays the sorted order, then displays the median value.
> ## What I learned:
> 1. Register indirect addressing  
> 2. Passing parameters  
> 3. Arrays  
> 4. Functional decomposition

> # Program 6 - String Converter
> Asks user for a string of digits, then converts the string into integers, validates them, and converts them back into a string, which is displayed back to the user.
> ## What I learned:
> 1. Macros  
> 2. System stack  
> 3. stosb/lodsb (store & load)
