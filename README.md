# Assembly
A series of programs written in Assembly Language (MASM)

> # Program 1 - Integer Arithmetic
> Asks user to enter 2 integers. Calculatesand diplays the sum, difference, product, and quotient/remainder of those numbers.
> ## What I learned:
> 1. MASM language  
> 2. Defining/Initializing variables  
> 3. I/O libraries  
> 4. Integer arithmetic

> # Program 2 - Fibonacci Numbers
> Asks user to enter how many Fib #'s, then displays that many Fib #'s to the screen.
> ## What I learned:
> 1. String input  
> 2. Counted loops  
> 3. Post-test loops  
> 4. Input validation

> # Program 3 - Accumulator
> Asks user to continually enter integers. As soon as a negative integer is entered, the previous integers are averaged. The quantity, the sum, and the average of the integers is displayed to the user.
> ## What I learned:
> 1. Data validation  
> 2. Accumulators  
> 3. Control structures

> # Program 4 - Composite Numbers
> Asks user how many composites to calculate, then for an integer. Calculates that given number of composites, up to the integer given.
> ## What I learned:
> 1. Nested loops  
> 2. Procedures

> # Program 5 - 
> ## How to compile:
> skkfk
> ## How to run:
> skkfk

> # Program 6 - 
> ## How to compile:
> skkfk
> ## How to run:
> skkfk
